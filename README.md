Hi! I'm Matiwos, a passionate Software Engineering student at Adama Science and Technology University (ASTU). I’m focused on building practical, offline-friendly tools that solve real-world problems — especially in education and knowledge organization.



🚀 What Drives Me

I believe software should be simple, powerful, and efficient. My mission is to:

🔧 Build  apps practically for real users

📱 Focus on offline-first mobile solutions that useable everywhere

💡 Learn deeply and solve meaningful real world and my community problems

🌍 Create impact through smart, minimal software


To add a contribution streak to your GitHub profile, you can use a dynamic badge or widget that displays your current streak. Here's how to do it using the popular GitHub Readme Streak Stats tool:
🔥 Steps to Add a GitHub Contribution Streak
- Create or Edit Your Profile README
- If you haven't already, create a repository named exactly like your GitHub username (e.g., matiwos/matiwos).
- Add a README.md file to that repo — this becomes your profile README.
- Use the Streak Stats Generator
- Visit the GitHub Readme Streak Stats project.
- Scroll down to the "Usage" section and use the provided URL format to embed your streak badge:
![GitHub Streak](https://streak-stats.demolab.com?user=YOUR_USERNAME&theme=default)
- Replace YOUR_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username.
- Customize the Appearance (Optional)
- You can customize the theme, background, border, and more by adding query parameters. For example:
![GitHub Streak](https://streak-stats.demolab.com?user=YOUR_USERNAME&theme=tokyonight&hide_border=true)


- Commit and Push
- Save your changes to the README.md file and push them to GitHub. Your profile will now display your contribution streak.
Let me know if you want help customizing the badge or combining it with other GitHub stats like top languages or total contributions!

Software should empower — not overwhelm. I build tools that simplify learning, boost productivity, and work even when the internet inaccessable.
